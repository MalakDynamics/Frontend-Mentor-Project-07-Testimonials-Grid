## Overview

More grid practice with this one, and a lot easier than my first foray. Still had issues making this match up with the Figma, just genuinely could not get that one to one match and I think the design in practice would need to look a bit different/have slightly different window responsiveness.

## My process

Mobile first as previously. I began with writing dataset classes to style different cards, but I shifted to a different solution giving different cards their own variables. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

Most exciting thing I learned was exploring the use of variable beyond `:root` implementation and learning the benefits that creates. The implementation of variables within each card class makes it much easier to navigate the css and I can tell it would be much more maintainable. I am excited to implement similar strategies moving forward.

### Continued development

I think that the better I learn Figma, the better my results will become in recreating from mockups. Getting that accuracy proved challenging on this one.
